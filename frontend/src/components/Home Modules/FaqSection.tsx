    question: "What is PayPact and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "PayPact is a tool to manage group payments on the Solana blockchain. An organizer creates a 'Pact,' and participants pay a fixed amount using a simple Solana Pay QR code. The system automatically tracks who has paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my friends need to be crypto experts to use this?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. We use Web3Auth, which allows new users to create a secure, self-custody wallet just by logging in with an email or social account. It's designed to be as simple as any standard web app.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why use Solana for payments?",
    answer:
      "Solana offers near-instant transaction speeds and extremely low fees (typically a fraction of a cent). This makes it perfect for frequent, small-to-medium-sized payments without high costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is PayPact secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All payments are processed directly on the Solana blockchain, inheriting its robust security. We never have custody of your funds; they move directly from the participant's wallet to the organizer's wallet.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are some real-world use cases for PayPact?",
    answer:
      "PayPact is ideal for collecting rent from roommates, splitting costs for a trip, managing club membership fees, or collecting payments for a course or workshop.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of tokens can I use to pay?",
    answer:
      "Currently, Pacts are typically created using stablecoins like USDC to ensure the payment value remains fixed. The organizer sets the specific token when creating the Pact.",
  },
